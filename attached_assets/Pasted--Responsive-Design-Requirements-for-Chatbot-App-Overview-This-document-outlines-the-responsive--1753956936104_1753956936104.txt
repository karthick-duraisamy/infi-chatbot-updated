# Responsive Design Requirements for Chatbot App

## Overview
This document outlines the responsive UI behavior for the "Airline Report Assistant" chatbot application, ensuring a seamless experience across device widths ranging from **320px to 1500px**.

---

## 1. General Responsive Range
- The layout must be responsive from **320px to 1500px** width.
- Use **flexbox** and **CSS media queries** to handle layout transitions.

---

## 2. Behavior When Width < 576px
- When screen width is **below 576px**:
  - The **'Airline Assistant'** title/component needs to be repositioned to adapt to a **modern compact layout** (reference: **ChatGPT mobile design**).
  - The title can move to the **top center** or be merged into a header bar, providing clarity and conserving space.
  - The **"New Chat"** button should be placed on the **right side** of the conversation header beside the "Airline Report Assistant".

---

## 3. Behavior When Width < 320px
- If the device width is **below 320px**:
  - Move the **"New Chat"** button into the **conversation header**, placed on the **right side**.

### Functional Behavior for All Small Screens:
- When the **New Chat** button is clicked:
  - It must **clear the existing conversation** or behave like the existing "clear chat" functionality.
  - Make sure the button is clearly visible and accessible.

### Sticky Header and Footer:
- When the user scrolls the conversation area on small devices (from **320px to 575px** and below):
  - The **header (Airline Report Assistant)** and the **footer (input/send area)** should remain **fixed**, similar to **WhatsApp chat UI**.

---

## 4. Configurable Display Mode via config.json
- Located at: `src/config/config.json`
- Key: `displayView`

### Behavior:
- If `displayView = "full"`:
  - The interface should work as it currently does (default fullscreen chat interface).
- If `displayView = "half"`:
  - The **chatbot icon** should appear in the **bottom right corner**.
  - When the **user clicks** the chatbot icon:
    - A chat interface like the one shown in the **attached screenshots** should be opened.
    - It should mimic a **slide-up panel or modal-style interface** embedded in the current screen.

---

## 5. Design References
- Follow the design system similar to **ChatGPT** and **WhatsApp**:
  - Responsive behavior
  - Sticky headers and footers for scrollable content
  - Mobile-first optimizations
  - Clear spacing and accessibility

---

## 6. Accessibility
- Ensure that all elements are accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
- Maintain touch-friendly spacing for small devices.

---

## 7. Technology Stack
- React
- Ant Design (antd) components for structure

---

## 8. Final Notes
- Test responsiveness across real devices and emulators.
- Pay attention to performance on small devices.
- Ensure consistent font scaling and padding.
